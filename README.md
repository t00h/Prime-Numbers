This project is a program which will print or save (to a text file) all prime numbers in order, or the next prime number after a given input number.
I am trying to do this as efficiently as possible (in Java in this repo - I might move to another, more efficient language in another repo to absolutely optimise efficiency).
To run the program, all you need to do is download the repo, then compile all Java source files. Run the compiled PrimeNumbers class in a CLI and follow instructions there.
If you can see any ways of improving efficiency, flag it in an issue or feel free to just fork then submit a pull of the fix.
